This posts describes the basics of Python reviewed at the beginning of our DANL 210 class.

An important aspect of the Python language is variables. These are used to store values such as strings, integers, lists, etc. An example of using this variables is:

```{python}
int_var = 10
str_var = "Hi!"
list_var = [1,2,3]
```



It is often helpful to use logical conditions when coding in Python. These operators work with the same logic as they would in a math class, but can be applied on non numerical values such as strings and lists as well.

```{python}
# These are not equal
10 != "10"

# These are equal 
"h" == "h"
2 == 2

# These are true inequalities
10 > 5
6 < 12
8 <= 13

# These are all false 
"10" == 10
"h" != "h"
2 != 2
10 < 5
```



Functions are another important part of coding in Python and can often be used to reduce repetition and allow for user interaction.

Below is an example of a function that computes the following polynomial: f(x) = x + 5

```{python}
# To define a function
def f(x):
  return x + 5

# To call the function
f(2)
```
